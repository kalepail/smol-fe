# Agent Onboarding Skill

## 1. Internalize the Manual
- Read `AGENTS.md` in the root.
- Read `docs/REPO_MAP.md` to understand the lay of the land.

## 2. Check the Ralph Loop
- Read `scripts/ralph/prd.json` to see what is PENDING/FAILING.
- Read `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` to see what has been recently done.

## 3. Work Habits
- **One Priority at a Time**: Pick the highest failing priority from PRD.
- **Verify**: Never claim "Done" without running a check.
- **Log**: Always append your work to `progress.txt`.

## 4. Updates
- If you find `AGENTS.md` outdated, update it immediately.
- If you find a new danger zone, add it to `docs/REPO_MAP.md`.
