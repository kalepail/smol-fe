## Codebase Patterns
- Keep audit outputs deterministic: write all artifacts to ./artifacts/audit/<timestamp>/
- Never mutate prod configs; use config.example.json + ENV overrides
- Hard-fail on invariant violations (C-only, XLM/KALE-only, Aquarius-only)

Thread: TBD
- Initialized Ralph workflow for swap-audit harness
- Pending implementation

[2026-01-16] - SWAP-001
Thread: N/A
	•	Implemented `scripts/swap-audit` structure.
	•	Created `audit.js` (JS/ESM) and `writeArtifacts.js`.
	•	Added `audit:swaps` command to `package.json`.
	•	Verified automated execution.

[2026-01-16 00:41] - SWAP-002
Thread: N/A (Direct Execution)
	•	Pivoted from Aquarius to Soroswap + xBull providers.
	•	Created `providers/soroswap.js` and `providers/xbull.js`.
	•	Updated `audit.js` with `--provider` flag.
	•	Verified both providers:
		- Soroswap: ✅ 10 XLM -> 2539 KALE (39 events)
		- xBull: ✅ 10 XLM -> 2642 KALE (26 events)
	•	Documented Aquarius research in `blockchain-transactions/aquarius-research.md`.
